Here it is, feast your eyes upon Tyler Carter's first website. Surviving only on 
the lifeblood of a virtual machine. May it never be forgotten. Currently a student
in INLS 161, Tyler is hoping to ascend to web development mastery. 

This one's to you, John! Here is your prize.

{% highlight ruby %}
def buildWebsite()
  puts "Autogenerating personal website, #{name}"
end
buildWebsite('Tyler')
#=> Autogenerates a personalized website for 'Tyler'. Wouldn't that be nice!
{% endhighlight %}
