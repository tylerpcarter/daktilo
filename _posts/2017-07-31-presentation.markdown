Here is a link to the github repository containing my presentation that I completed using Audacity and Reveal.js framework.

**[LINK TO GITHUB REPOSITORY HERE](https://github.com/tylerpcarter/task-5-presentation)**

This presentation is about the negative consequences of pesticide use with agricultural produce. The presentation is entirely electronic, and I used Audacity to record my voice in presenting each slide. 

To do this, I used the INSTRUCTIONS.md as a guideline to produce reveal.md, which contains the content of the presentation. Next, I used the provided script to convert reveal.md into an appropriated html document, index.html, that produced the presentation. The audio files were uploaded into the audio directory and data-audio-src="audio/filename.ogg" was added to every slide title tag.
