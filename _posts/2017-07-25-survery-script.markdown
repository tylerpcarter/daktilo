**This Script:**

* Creates a list of five survey-type questions, then prompts the user to answer them. A unique identifier tag is added to the user's input. Then,a timestamp is recorded.Creates

* After recording all data, a CSV file is created where that data is then trasferred into a MySQL database that has appropriated variables and variable types for the survey questions. 

* A script then writes the data into the MySQL Database and creates a table in the database if one hasn't been created. After populating the table, the MySQL database is then dumped into a .sql file in the
repository with a timestamp filename.repository
